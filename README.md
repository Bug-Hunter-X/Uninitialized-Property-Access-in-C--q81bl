This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in C#: accessing uninitialized properties.  Uninitialized properties can lead to unpredictable results, particularly when dealing with value types (like `int` in this example). The `bug.cs` file contains the problematic code. The solution involves properly initializing the property, either in the constructor or before accessing it.
